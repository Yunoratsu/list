We started the file handling with a simple array but in the end we noticed that something else was needed to save each file
stat structure (for size, permissions, etc). After this, we changed the program a little, and tried to print according to
the real ls (we are not done yet), and tried to do more "portable" stuff but rn is not even close....

We will continue our tests until the final version, this is just a beta or wtvr someone may call this strap.
